The ARDC Virtual Desktop Service is a managed service hosted on the ARDC Nectar Research Cloud. You login from https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-nectar-research-cloud/ardc-virtual-desktop-service/ using your UQ credentials via the AAF Login portal. You will then be required to accept the Terms of Service and fill in a short questionaire before you can create a new workspace. You can choose from a range of different desktops. Your desktop will start with 8 vCPUs, 16GB of memory and 50GB of disk space. There is a boost function that will allow you to use 16 vCPUs and 32GB of memory if necessary. By default, the desktop will be available for up to 14 days, although you can request an extension of up to 14 days from the time that you make your extension request. You can also shelve your desktop for up to 30 days when not in use. You will not be able to create another desktop while you have an active desktop, even if it is currently shelved.
