TERN provides a range of services to the Ecosystem Research Community. This include the Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis (CoESRA) Virtual Desktop hosted on the QRISCloud nodes of the ARDC Nectar Research Cloud.  They offer Desktops based on Ubuntu Linux preconfigured with a range of useful software (https://coesra.tern.org.au/applications). You can sign in using your University ID via the Australian Access Federation or authenticating through Google or CILogon. You will need to fill in a questionaire to obtain access to the Desktops. Unlike the ARDC virtual desktop, there is a delay before access is granted. You do not get admin access on these desktops, so you will only be able to install software that can be installed with standard user privilleges
