The ARDC Nectar Research Cloud (Nectar) is Australiaâ€™s national research cloud, specifically designed for research computing. You can login to the Nectar Dashboard via the AAF (Australian Access Federation) option on the Login page. If you are new Nectar you will automatically be granted a trial project for up to 6 months. The time length allowed varies depending on the resources used. You can run two small virtual machines or one medium virtual machine for 3 months, or one small virtual machine for 6 months. This will give you an opportunity to experiment with the features of the system. You can also request further allocation of resources through the Allocations Tab at the bottom of the menu. In order to do this you will need to connect your Nectar profile to your ORCID profile. You will not be able to make a request if you don't have an ORCID ID. Fill out the  application form providing details of the resources you require and the research you intend to undertake. Your application will be assessed and you will be notified of the decision in due course.
